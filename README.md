# Sustainability Game

## Gameplay

This is a modification of an existing Threejs based SIMCITY: https://github.com/dgreenheck/simcity-threejs-clone. The idea of the game is to survive as many rounds as possible by fulfilling the needs of population (energy & food) - energy & food should not fall below zero, and GreenHouseGas (GHG) value should not exceed 50. In each round, population will grow and user can select to place food shop/energy plant, or to do nothing. You are given initial $1000 to start the game with.

## How do I run this locally?

You will first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

After that, clone this repository, navigate to the root directory and run the following command

```bash
npm run dev
```
